# python-challenge
The tutor helped me understand the difference between git pull and git push and how to get information from GitBash and Visual Studio to sync with GitHub. He also helped me set up my file to write code in each of the project folders. I learned how to write code so that the python file pulls the correct csv file to pull data from.
